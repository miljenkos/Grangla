    <string name="help_text">Try to collect four symbols in a row. To win you need to do that more often than your opponent. You get the right to do the next move after a certain amount of time since your last one has passed. The game gets faster as it approaches the end. Do not make excess moves because you lose your symbols if you put too many on the board.</string>
